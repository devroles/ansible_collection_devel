# Ansible Collection - devroles.devel

A collection of Ansible roles to configure and setup a machine for different
development environments

While the roles are primarily developed with Fedora/CentOS/RHEL in
mind, there is nothing stopping them from being usable in other
systems. Those which already support it will advertise it within their
own space. Others can be expanded to include support for other
distributions when the need arises or when a PR is submitted to
support them.
